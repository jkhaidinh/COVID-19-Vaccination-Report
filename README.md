# COVID-19-Vaccination-Report
This is a project for my PSTAT 100 course at UC Santa Barbara.

Our report looks into COVID vaccinations, vaccine equity metric quartile, and political parties by each county or zip code. Our goal in this report is to see whether higher vaccine equity metric quartile means higher COVID vaccinations as well as whether higher vaccinations is tied to a Democratic majority county. We will look into the various plots to analyze the data and ultimately come up with a conclusion if there is any correlation.

# Data
Refer to the covid-19-dataset folder for the datasets.

# Code
There are two separate files. 

The project-code.ipynb file is the code for:
- tidying data
- comparing data to see if there's correlation
- visualization (plots, graphs, etc.)

The project-report.ipynb files is the report. The images are missing but refer to the covid-report.pdf for everything.
